I live in Columbia Missouri. I attended the University of Missouri here and earned a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science.  C was the first programming language I ever learned, followed by Assembly and Perl. Weird, I know.  When I wasn't having fun in college I took interest in web development and haven't stopped since.

When not tinkering with web technology, I tinker with Cocoa and Objective-c.  To date I've written [Github Notifier](https://github.com/ctshryock/GithubNotifier) and [Faces.app](/faces-app.html), the former you can find on Github, the latter is in a state of limbo.  You can see my other activities on my [Github](http://github.com/ctshryock) or [projects](/projects.html) page.

Currently I work for a web development company based out of Iowa City, Iowa.  I make awesome things with PHP, Ruby, Rails, Rack, Jekyll, Cocoa and Cocoa Touch, basically anything that grabs my interest.
