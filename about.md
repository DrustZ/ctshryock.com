I attended the University of Missouri, Columbia, where I received my Bachelors of Science in Computer Science.  C was the first programming language I ever learned, followed by Assembly and Perl.  When I wasn't having fun in college I took interest in web development and haven't stopped since.

I started working with Cocoa and Objective-c in 2004 with my first Apple computer, a Powerbook G4.  To date I've written [Github Notifier](https://github.com/ctshryock/GithubNotifier) and [Faces.app](/faces-app.html), the former you can find on Github, the latter is in a state of limbo.  You can see my other activities on my [Github](http://github.com/ctshryock) or [projects](/projects.html) page.

Currently I work for a web development company based out of Iowa City, Iowa, while I reside in central Missouri.  I work with PHP, Ruby on Rails, Rack apps, Jekyll, Mac, iOS development, basically almost anything that grabs my interest.
