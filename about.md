I live in Columbia Missouri. I attended the University of Missouri here and earned a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science.  C was the first programming language I ever learned, followed by Assembly and Perl. Weird, I know.  When I wasn't having fun in college I took interest in web development and haven't stopped since.

When not tinkering with web technology, I tinker with Ruby, Cocoa and Objective-c.  To date I've written [Github Notifier](https://github.com/ctshryock/GithubNotifier) and [Faces.app](/faces-app.html), the former you can find on Github, the latter is in a state of limbo.  You can see my other activities on my [Github](http://github.com/ctshryock) or [projects](/projects.html) page.

I currently work for [Heroku][1] as an awesome Support Engineer. I like
to make awesome things with Ruby, Rails, Cocoa and Cocoa Touch, Legos or other
shiny things.
