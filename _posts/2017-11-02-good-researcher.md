Two months since I came to Seattle. Nearly four months after I wrote my last journal. Guess I have to write one, or else I may lose the ability to write.

I just start write in English, to practice my bilingual writing skills :) After all, the conference in HCI only accept English paper (sad
 
Coincidentally my professor Chun Yu in Tsinghua comes UW today. He is my "boss" while I was in HCI lab in Tsinghua back then. We met after I finished my class after 5:30 pm. 
 
The weather is cold, as the rain just stopped and wind blows ceaselessly. But it feels great to see someone I'm familiar in a faraway place. We went to a Korean restaurant, walking and talking. 
 
"Have you already been assigned with an advisor?" He asked me. I told him my advisor was Prof. Wobbrock.
Then we began to discuss about Jake's work. Chun's work mainly focuses on novel engineering projects, aiming to solve practical problems. He mentioned that Jake's work was more about methodology and many were too simple. 
 
"I feel like your professor's work includes not too much high technology, instead, they are some simple ideas that are easy to use. At the same time, they are JUST what people use in their research but won't treat seriously, because the problems are so nuanced. " Chun said.
 
I have the same feeling to some degree. Jake's paper is pretty straightforward, without too much complex technology or theory. However, he can find some "valuable" points, and deal with them in a simple way. I remember when we met for the first time, he told me that "the easier, the more elegant".
 
"However, not everyone is like him," Chun looked at me, "and you have to build your real strength. Finding a problem and coming up with an easy solution? It is not a solid skill."
 
Chun talked about the research they current engaged in. "A typing method using one's peripheral vision, so that we won't look at the keyboard when typing on tablet", or "touch with ear, enable the blind to interact with the smart phone" and a lot of other cool stuffs. One common thing of all the research is: useful. Their lab is collaborating with two companies now: Sogou and Huawei, and several companies including Apple have sent them the invitation of potential collaboration. 
 
We also talked about HCI education in UW. I mentioned that the courses in Information school is very interdisciplinary and systematic. We have a class called "research method in HCI", which covers basically main methods in HCI research. We also put importance on "methodology and human value", not too much on the technology side. 
 
Chun's value on HCI is more aligned with mine. I want to build something that could make people's life more convenient, which means I must have the ability to "build". A strong skillset of engineering and research should be a must. 
 
I may spend some time thinking my future study in PhD, about my area and how to reach my goal. Chun is right, not everyone can find a simple way to solve a common problem. Even they can, that's way too simple.

Chun is going to be a visiting scholar from next year, Febrary. I'm looking forward to collaborate with him on some more "practical" and "high engineering" projects.
