title: Making Super Awesome Oreo Balls     
---        

It's Christmas time _(technically past at the time of publish)_.  Christmas to me means family, friends, and Super Awesome Oreo Balls.

What's a super Awesome Oreo ball?  This is a super awesome Oreo ball:

</div>

Composed of Oreo and cream cheese wrapped in a layer of chocolate.  Perhaps you just started drooling.  This is normal.  

Lucky for you making Super Awesome Oreo Balls is super easy.  

###Steps to reproduce

            Fill your blender to the top with Oreos.  If you have Oreos left over, you can add them after you blend the first round down some.  
            </li>
            <li>
            Use a "pulse" blend method by hitting blend for about 1 second; this allows the Oreos that are not blended (on the top) to sift down to the blades and get chopped.  Otherwise, the Oreos on bottom would just get finer and finer while chunks remain on top.

    <dd>
        Melt your chocolate covering in the microwave.  Be careful not to overcook or melt the chocolate; it needs to be hot enough to be easily stirred with a spoon, but not so melted it's like water.

        Grab a chunk of the mix and round it into a ball, approximately the size of a ping pong ball or smaller.  The end product is pretty rich so anything bigger and you may struggle to eat the whole thing in one sitting.
