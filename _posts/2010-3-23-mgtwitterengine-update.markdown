Yesterday I updated the main branch of [MGTwitterEngine][1] by combining my fork with [tarasis][2] and [alexrepty][3] forks.  With over 35 some commits in all, I felt lucky there was very little manual merging required.

Since [Matt][4] has created and official source of [MGTwitterEngine][5] I feel like it's gained a lot of momentum.  There are 8 active forks, feature requests and bugs reports starting to accumulate in the issues list, and over 180 watchers.
