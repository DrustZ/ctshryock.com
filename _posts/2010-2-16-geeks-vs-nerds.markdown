__Clint__ : nice  
__Clint__ : I'll have to bookmark this in case I ever switch back to Textmate  
__Blake__ : haha  
__Blake__ : still in Vim?  
__Clint__ : yes  
__Clint__ : LOVE it  
__Blake__ : nerd  
__Blake__ : ;)  
__Clint__ : It's pronounced "geek", _du-mass_  
__Blake__ : no, geek's like star wars and role playing games... nerds do extra efficient commandline nerd crap  
__Clint__ : Really?  So playing D&D is geeky and not nerdy?  
__Blake__ : yeah, nerdy is smart and technical  
__Blake__ : geeky is socially awkward and obsessive about the aforementioned geeky things  
__Clint__ : I must be a rare hybrid than.  All their strengths, none of their weaknesses.  
__Blake__ : geeks might even call you "day-walker"  
__Blake__ : ;)  
__Clint__ : HAH  
__Clint__ : nice  
__Blake__ : yeah, i'm REALLY proud of that one  
__Blake__ : might print this convo out and frame it  
__Clint__ : I'm blogging this  
__Blake__ : haha, awesome
