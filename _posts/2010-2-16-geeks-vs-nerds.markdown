**Clint** : nice  
**Clint** : I'll have to bookmark this in case I ever switch back to Textmate  
**Blake** : haha  
**Blake** : still in Vim?  
**Clint** : yes  
**Clint** : LOVE it  
**Blake** : nerd  
**Blake** : ;)  
**Clint** : It's pronounced "geek", _du-mass_  
**Blake** : no, geek's like star wars and role playing games... nerds do extra efficient commandline nerd crap  
**Clint** : Really?  So playing D&D is geeky and not nerdy?  
**Blake** : yeah, nerdy is smart and technical  
**Blake** : geeky is socially awkward and obsessive about the aforementioned geeky things  
**Clint** : I must be a rare hybrid than.  All their strengths, none of their weaknesses.  
**Blake** : geeks might even call you "day-walker"  
**Blake** : ;)  
**Clint** : HAH  
**Clint** : nice  
**Blake** : yeah, i'm REALLY proud of that one  
**Blake** : might print this convo out and frame it  
**Clint** : I'm blogging this  
**Blake** : haha, awesome
