I've taken a big interest in [JRFeedbackProvider](http://github.com/rentzsch/jrfeedbackprovider/tree/master), already with two (albeit small) patches ready and I filed a new bug on the latest update.  JRFeedbackProvider is a add-on to your cocoa app that will let the user easily submit feedback to you, be it a bug, feature request or support request, and all you need to do is copy the files and make a menu item connection, and use the provided php script on your server (or write your own in your language of choice).

This project has given me a great chance to get in to contributing to open source projects, it's scope is reasonable and there seems to be room for development that I can take swings at.  I'd like to start a Zend project to act as a collector of these feedback reports, not as a bug tracker, but as a bug/feature/support filtering system.  A place that collects reports from the wild and the developer can then make decisions to discard, reply to, or push over any issue to their bug tracker of choice.
