I'm taking a break from Twitter, effective today, October 11th 2010, until November 1st.  I've removed Twitteriffic and Tweetie from my iPhone and MacBook, as well as the Facebook app for iPhone.  

Too much of my free time is spent checking updates and not _doing something_; paying attention to a conversation, doing something constructive, noticing things around me.  An hour wouldn't go by where I didn't check _some status somewhere_.  I've thought about it and I'm simply too connected and not balancing; I need to unplug.

See you in November!
