<p>Last night we had some friends over for dinner and drinks, and I got my first hands on experience with the <a href="http://www.motorola.com/Consumers/US-EN/Consumer-Product-and-Services/Mobile-Phones/Motorola-DROID-US-EN">Motorola Droid</a> and I must say it was the most impressive one yet.</p>

<p>First, the Droid is not near a bulky and ugly as the pictures I had seen lead me to believe.  For whatever reasons I thought it was larger and thicker, but it was really quite nice.<br/>
</p>

<p>Secondly, I've never seen such a responsive Android phone; in my experiences with the G1 and a recent HTC I was not impressed with the lag/sluggishness, but the Droid seemed spot on.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s great to see a good implementation of Android.  I haven&rsquo;t heard how the <a href="http://www.google.com/phone">Google Nexus One</a> is, but I have high hopes for Android being a good competitor to the iPhone and iPhone OS.  Competition will (hopefully) make both stronger.</p>
