MacGrams is a little Mac app for interacting with your [Instagram][1] feeds.  
Out of the box, MacGrams displays the Popular feed of images in image browser, 
where you can browse, zoom, favorite, and comment on any image.  

Authenticating with your account gives you access to your personal feed,
as well as your friends that you follow.  Each feed is seperated into
it's own group just like different media in iTunes.
