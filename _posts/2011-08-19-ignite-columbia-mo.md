Last night was Columbia's first [Ignite][1] event, hosted by the [Social Media Club of Mid-Missouri][2]. I had the
privilege of presenting on my passion, "Hacking".

The Media focuses on one tiny part of hacking, "cracking" as White
Hats like to call it, and labels it Hacking. The general population's
mental image of hackers follows suit.  

Hacking isn't about breaking into computer systems, stealing
digital things or causing mayhem on the internet.  Hacking is
_exploring_.  Hacking is _creating_.  Hacking is _diving deep into the
essence of something in order to understand it_. The _act_ of hacking is more
akin to playfulness, cleverness, and exploration, not violating the bits
of a computer or network.  

Hacking isn't wrong, bad, or illegal. It shouldn't be frowned upon or mistrusted. It should be encouraged. Hacking is curiosity at play. Hacking
is learning. Hacking is breaking down limitations and going beyond them. 

And it certainly isn't isolated to computers and software.
