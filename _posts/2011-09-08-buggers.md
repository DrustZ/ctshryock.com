  "When Ender Wiggin holds our fleets in his control, when he must 
make the decisions that bring us victory or destruction, will there 
be military police to come save him if things get out of hand?
  "I fail to see the connection."
  "Obviously. But the connection is there. Ender Wiggin must believe
that no matter what happens, no adult will ever, ever step in to 
help him in any way. He must believe, to the core of his soul, that 
he can only do what he and the other children work out for 
themselves. If he does not believe that, then he will never reach 
the peak of his abilities."

**You can only do what you work out for yourself. No one is going to save you.**
