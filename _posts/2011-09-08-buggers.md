**No one is going to save you.**

*\*This is a post in progress\**

This is a different take on the familiar "You can do anything if
you put your mind to it!" idea. Instead of rainbows and sunshine though,
I aim to smack you in the face.

<pre>
  "When Ender Wiggin holds our fleets in his control, when he must 
make the decisions that bring us victory or destruction, will there 
be military police to come save him if things get out of hand?
  "I fail to see the connection."
  "Obviously. But the connection is there. Ender Wiggin must believe
that no matter what happens, no adult will ever, ever step in to 
help him in any way. He must believe, to the core of his soul, that 
he can only do what he and the other children work out for 
themselves. If he does not believe that, then he will never reach 
the peak of his abilities."

  There was no doubt now in Ender's mind. There was no help for him.
Whatever he faced, now and forever, no one would save him from it.
