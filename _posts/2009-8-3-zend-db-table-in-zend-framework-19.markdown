I'm reading up on [Zend Db Table](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.db.table.html "Zend Db Table") as part of getting to better know the technologies we've adopted at [Delta Systems Group](http://deltasys.com "Delta Systems Group, where I work") and have found that now as of [Zend Framework 1.9](http://framework.zend.com "Zend Framework home") you no longer "have to extend a base class and configure it to do simple operations such as selecting, inserting, updating and deleteing on a single table".

That's welcome news from the last time I took a look at Zend (circa release 1.4ish).  Zend has really grown since then and it's quickly become an exciting platform for PHP developers such as myself.
