I attended [C4[2]][1] back in 2008 where the crew from [280 North][2] gave a presentation on the [Cappuccino web framework][3].  I have mixed feelings about Cappuccino, the technology itself seems amazing but it's a big leap from "normal" users web app experience.  I plan to spend a weekend with it and try it out for myself.
