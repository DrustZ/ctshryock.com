If you do any Rack or Ruby on Rails development, you should checkout
[Pow][1], the zero configuration Rack server for OS X. Pow makes
getting up and running with these apps dead simple.  No `rails server`
one app at a time, no Apache/Passenger configs setup, no mucking with `/etc/hosts`.  Pow doesn't 
require special privileges (runs as your user), with no gems or
extensions to intall.  Just Pow, and it installs in seconds.

From the manual:

>How does it work? A few simple conventions eliminate the need for tedious configuration. Pow runs as your user on an unprivileged port, and includes both an HTTP and a DNS server. The installation process sets up a firewall rule to forward incoming requests on port 80 to Pow. It also sets up a system hook so that all DNS queries for a special top-level domain (.dev) resolve to your local machine.


###The good and bad: ###

- Any request to **\*.dev** is sent to Pow
- Pow **by default** hijacks port 80

You **can** configure that last one, and it's simple to do so, incase you do any other type of development where you already have something like Apache setup to handle those requests. Wihout configuring otherwise Pow will respond instead and likely not know what to do.


###Setup and App###

Pow creates a `~/.pow` directory in your home folder. To setup an app
with Pow, `cd` there and create a symlink:

{% highlight bash %}

$ cd ~/.pow
$ ln -s /some/rackapp

{% endhighlight %}

**Done!**  Visit `http://rackapp.dev` and you're rack app will load
before your awe-struck eyes.

###But what about my port 80?###

Yeah, you probably want that back huh...



-  reconfigure to use port 88
-  options like restart and always\_restart
-  powder
-  some other junk from the manual  

  -  .powcx or something
