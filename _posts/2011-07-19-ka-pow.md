If you do any Rack or Ruby on Rails development, you should checkout
[Pow][1], the zero configuration Rack server for OS X. 

Pow makes getting up and running with these apps dead simple.  No `rails server`
one app at a time, no Apache/Passenger configs setup, no mucking with `/etc/hosts`.  Pow doesn't 
require special privileges (runs as your user), with no gems or
extensions to intall.  Just Pow, and it installs in seconds.

From the manual:

>How does it work? A few simple conventions eliminate the need for tedious configuration. Pow runs as your user on an unprivileged port, and includes both an HTTP and a DNS server. The installation process sets up a firewall rule to forward incoming requests on port 80 to Pow. It also sets up a system hook so that all DNS queries for a special top-level domain (.dev) resolve to your local machine.


###The good and bad: ###

- Any request to **\*.dev** is sent to Pow
- Pow **by default** hijacks port 80

You **can** configure that last one, and it's simple to do so, incase you do any other type of development where you already have something like Apache setup to handle those requests. Without configuring otherwise Pow will respond instead and likely not know what to do.


###Setup and App###

Pow creates a `~/.pow` directory in your home folder. To setup an app
with Pow, `cd` there and create a symlink:

{% highlight bash %}

$ cd ~/.pow
$ ln -s /some/rackapp

{% endhighlight %}

**Done!**  Visit `http://rackapp.dev` and you're rack app will load
before your awe-struck eyes.

###But what about my port 80?###

Yeah, you probably want that back huh...
Fortunately you can do a one or two things, detailed on [this helpful wiki][2] on
the Pow Github project. It outlines two steps, but depending on your
setup, you may can get by with just the first one.

On boot, Pow will read a `~/.powconfig` file if you have one.  Put the
following there:

{% highlight bash %}
# ~/.powconfig
export POW_DST_PORT=88

{% endhighlight %}

That there is enough to tell Pow not to hijack port 80, but instead use
port **88**.

From there forward, just add `:88` to your app urls, a la
`http://rackapp.dev:88`. Apache will still use port 80 and your other
apps will be fine, while any Pow app now responds to
`<app-name>.dev:88`.

If you like the idea of not having to specify a port _at all_, you can
do the additional setup of adding an Apache conf file in
`/etc/apache2/other/` that tells Apache to act as a reverse proxy for
Pow instead.  

{% highlight bash %}
$ sudo curl https://raw.github.com/gist/1058580/zzz_pow.conf -o /etc/apache2/other/zzz_pow.conf
$ sudo apachectl restart
{% endhighlight %}


The naming is important; you want Apache to behave like normal for all
requests and then serve anything that doesn't match your other host
files to the Pow server.  

###Pow[der]###

Pow has already made your life better, what more could you want?  

You're right, `cd ~/.pow` and creating a symlink _is_ asking an awful lot of me 
just to run multiple Rack apps simultaneously with no hassle...

So you use [Powder][3], a handy little gem that lets you link and unlink Pow apps without
leaving the comfort of your `cwd`. And hey, it gives you a bit more insight to what Pow's doing too.

{% highlight bash %}
$ powder help
