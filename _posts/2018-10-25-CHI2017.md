Best of CHI 2017 : the Missing Part

While I'm seeking for some material as my daily readings, I decided to read best papers of CHI (the ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems). I found a really [nice page](https://jeffhuang.com/best_paper_awards.html) by Jeff Huang collecting best papers from many top-tier conferences in CS. Mysteriously, all records suddenly stopped at 2016. So I went to https://chi2018.acm.org/attending/best-of-chi/ for best papers in CHI 2018. However, CHI 17 does not provide a searchable link for best papers. Thus I decided to fill the missing part here.

#### BEST PAPER CHI 2017

### Crawl ACM DL and find best papers
The way I got them is to crawl the [ACM Digital Library](https://dl.acm.org/). Search "*CHI 2017*" and refine the publication name with "*CHI '17: Proceedings of the 2017 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems*". We got 601 results. Then we will find that the best paper/honorable mention ones will have a small badge on their detail page (like [this one](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3025804)). Thus we can crawl each page in the result, and see if there's such badge information in the page.

The crawler I used is [Scrapy](https://scrapy.org/), and it's super convenient to use. For reference, I put the crawler code here (and don't forget to edit the user-agent because ACM DL disabled crawler). 

```python
