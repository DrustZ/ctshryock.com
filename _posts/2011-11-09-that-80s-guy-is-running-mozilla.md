title: "That 80s Guy is running Mozilla"

Awhile back Mozilla announced their 2011 roadmap, taking Firefox from
v4 all the way to (atleast) v7 by years end. Today I updated to v8, not
because I use Firefox, but because I heard it was out and thought I'd
see what's new.

I hear it has integrated Twitter search.  That's about all I've heard is
new.

It feels odd to jump from this  
![Version 7.0.1]({{site.baseurl}}/static/images/ff_7_0_1.png)

To this  
![Version 8.0]({{site.baseurl}}/static/images/ff_8_0.png)

But hey, whatever works
