title: "Git Flow at CoMo Rich Web"
category: posts
---



Last night at the [CoMo Rich Web][2] meet-up I gave a quick lighting talk on using [Git-Flow][1] in your
projects. Afterwards [Scott Davis of ThirstyHead][3] gave a great talk
on HTML5, <strike> which I'm trying to find a link to the
slides.</strike> who's [slides are available here][7].

You can view my talk at [ctshryock.github.com/git-flow-talk][4], source
[here][5].

For my slides I used [ShowOff][6], a Sinatra app that reads
simple files and creates an HTML presentation.  Having used
Keynote for my previous talk on Git, I really like the simplicity of
ShowOff, both in capabilities and actual usage.  Not being terrible
graphically gifted, I often felt overwhelmed using Keynote.  The
simplicity of ShowOff felt much more at home for me.
