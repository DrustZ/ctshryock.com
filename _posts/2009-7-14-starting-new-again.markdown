I've started a new site again.  <strike>I enjoyed writing my last one using the Zend Framework but ultimately I don't want to maintain it, I'd rather be writing.  I've tried schedules for blogging before but I think this time I'm just going to keep notes through out the day and try to post example code and other stuff I can derive from what I work on.</strike>

This site is setup using <strike>Movable Type</strike> [Jekyll][1], which so far is proving to be very nice.  See [Powered by Jekyll](/2010/12/07/powered-by-jekyll.html) for details,
