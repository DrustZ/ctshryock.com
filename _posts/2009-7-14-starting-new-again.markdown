I've started a new site again.  I enjoyed writing my last one using the Zend Framework but ultimately I don't want to maintain it, I'd rather be writing.  I've tried schedules for blogging before but I think this time I'm just going to keep notes through out the day and try to post example code and other stuff I can derive from what I work on.

This site is setup using Movable Type, which so far is proving to be very nice
