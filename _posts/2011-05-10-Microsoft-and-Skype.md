A company whos product I use day in and day out as part of my job is
being acquired by a larger company who I don't really care for but am no doubt
indebted to.  I have mixed feelings about this.  

Since September 2010 I've been working at [CramerDev][1], and a key to
our communication has been Skype.  Per-project group chats as well as
video chat when needed, it's been a great tool. 

We're mostly a Mac shop (another key to our success IMO).  Needless to
say [Skype 5][2] was seen as a horrible, horrible sin delivered upon us, as [others eloquently put][3].  I immediately reverted to Skype 2.8 ([and you should too][4]) 

I'm not really worried about this.  Skype 5 is
pretty bad, and Skype 2.x is still supported.  If Microsoft screws this
up, which it may, I'm sure another competitor will shine and we'll
migrate.  I've been hearing a lot of great things about [Campfire][5]
lately.  

Lastly, [this GigaOM article][6] sums up my prediction for both
companies in this regard:

> It wonâ€™t surprise me if Microsoft comes in for major heat on this
> decision to buy Skype &mdash; and the software company could always
> botch this purchase, as it often does when it buys a company. The
> Skype team is also full of hired guns who are likely to move on to the
> next opportunity rather than dealing with the famed Microsoft
> bureaucracy.h
