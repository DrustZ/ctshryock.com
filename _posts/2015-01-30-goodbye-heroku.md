Today is my last day working at Heroku.  
The last day I get to call myself a Herokai.  
The last day I log in to the best job I’ve ever had to date.  

I came onboard in October of 2012, a time that seems so long ago but passed too quickly. I am forever grateful for those that helped me get there. I had [excellent][1] [mentors][2] (or “bosses” as some call them), and so many brilliant and amazing co-workers I don’t have enough words to list them, let alone describe them. I learned so much at Heroku, including how far I still have to go, and leveled up several times. 

The people, the culture, and mission, are all _**amazing**_. 

The week following will be a funemployement week for me, then on February 9th I’ll be joining A New Team[^note] and start working on some things that I’m really excited about.

I’m thankful for the opportunity Heroku and the Herokai gave me. I’m excited to see what Heroku ships in the future, and to watch Heroku continue to blaze a trail forward.

But for now, I’m off to new adventures!
