 I'm looking to get more involved with open source projects, both Cocoa and PHP/Zend.  I'm currently a contributor to the [Canary twitter client](http://github.com/macsphere/canary/tree/master) and looking to give back to [JRFeedbackProvider](http://github.com/rentzsch/jrfeedbackprovider/tree/master) after I integrate it into my app.  

I also have some code I want to share: I've got a category for CALayer to find a sublayer by name, and a category to [MGTwitterEngine](http://mattgemmell.com/2008/02/22/mgtwitterengine-twitter-from-cocoa) to allow for image upload, adding the missing update_profile_image API call.  Hope to put those on github soon.
