Greetings! I'm Mingrui Zhang, a second year Ph.D. in the University of Washington [Information School]. My advisor is Prof. [Jacob O. Wobbrock], who directs the [ACE Lab].

My research interests are in Human-Computer Interaction, specifically text entry, input methods, and interaction techniques, where I seek better methods to make technology natural and seamless. 

Before moving to Seattle, I was a student of Computer Science & Technology in Tsinghua University, China, where I worked as a researcher as well as in industry. Back then, [Dr. Chun Yu] opened the world of HCI to me.

I enjoy playing computer games in my spare time, but you know, I rarely have spare time :)
