Greetings! I'm Mingrui Zhang, a first year PhD in [iSchool], University of Washington. My advisor is Prof. [Jacob O. Wobbrock], who directs the [MAD Lab].

My research interests Human-Computer Interaction, specifically Text Entry, Input Method and User Interfaces, where I seek for better methods to make the input technology natural and seamless. 

Before moving to Seattle, I was a student of Computer Science & Technology in Tsinghua University, China, where I did a lot of explorations in research as well as industry. Back then, [Dr.Chun Yu] opened the world of HCI to me.

I enjoy playing computer games in my spare time, but you know, I rarely have spare time :)
